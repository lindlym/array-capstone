# Les Finale (The Capstone)

Congratulations, you've made it to the end of the road! In this final capstone project, you'll be tackling building a native application using one of the relevant languages. This project will be a **solo** project, and it will be up to you to create your own theme, come up with your own idea, as well as submit a written proposal for the project. 

### Technologies Required

- React Native (Mobile Applications) or Electron (Desktop Applications).
- NodeJS, ExpressJS, Mongoose.
- MongoDB.

### What needs to be in the proposal?

When it comes to the proposal, you need to write up a document that showcases what you want the application to be (only two pages max). This should follow the "problem, solution" pattern of problem solving; where you have a problem and your application will be the solution! It should showcase specifically what your application's pages will look like, as well as have general wireframes (not full designs!) included in the document.

If everything looks good, and I think the project can be finished in that amount of time, you will be given a thumbs up to begin work on it!
